## 💡 Project Summary & Structure

This project is a personal, responsive, one-page portfolio designed to showcase my skills as an Aspiring Web Developer, Python Learner, and AI enthusiast. The website adopts a modern, dark, neon-themed aesthetic, inspired by terminal interfaces, to create a striking and memorable user experience. The key goal is to present my diverse skill set and project experience in a coherent and visually engaging manner for potential employers and academic assessors

**Layout:** 
One-page, long-scrolling layout.
**Justification:**
 Chosen to provide a fast and continuous user experience, allowing visitors to quickly scan all critical sections (About, Skills, Projects, Contact) without traditional multi-page navigation.

     Core structure and semantic markup.

     Utility-first framework for rapid development and responsiveness.

     Used extensively for the unique aesthetics, including all custom animations and neon effects.
 **JavaScript:** 
      Used for interactive elements and integration of the `matter.js` library for background effects.

## ✨ Key Features

 **Neon Terminal Skills Section:** 
     A custom-styled component that emulates a command-line interface to display skills (HTML, Python, AI/ML, etc.) with a blinking cursor effect.
 **Interactive Background:** 
     Integrates the **`matter.js`** library for a subtle, dynamic, gravity-simulated visual element in the hero section.
 **Advanced CSS Animations:** 
     Includes custom keyframe animations (`float`, `glow`, `pulse`, `shimmer`) for a modern, high-tech aesthetic on the logo and interactive components.
 **Gradient Text:** 
     Applies a linear gradient color fill (`#1595b6` to `#4595eb`) to all main section titles using non-standard CSS properties.
 **Fully Responsive:**
     Built with a mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS for cross-device compatibility.
